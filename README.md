# TetrisGame-Python

## How to Run the game
  You need to add pygame library first. The easiest way is through the `pip`.  
  Afterward just run the `Tetris.py` file.  
 
## Gameplay
  Unfortunately, for now there is no menu or option menu created. So you need to use this guide.  
  Game functions are available through keyboard. Five keys implemented.  
  - Up Arrow: Rotate the Block  
  - Down Arrow: Soft Drop 
  - Right Arrow: Move Block to Right  
  - Left Arrow: Move Block to Left  
  - Space: Hard Drop  
  There's a config file available to change resolution and game options. You don't need the file. It will be created on runtime but if you want to change the settings feel free to edit it.  
  
### TODO
  1. Menu and Option Menu  
  2. Graphical Enhancements  
  3. Add Sounds  
  4. Make it Functional for Mouse and Joystick Inputs  
  5. Add Effects Maybe  
  
#### Feel free to make contact and report issue or PR! ;)

P.S. It's early morning and I'm too sleepy. I'll make the readme file better soon! :)
